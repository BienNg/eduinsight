- **Validation**: Checks for active courses and warns users

### Data Integrity
- Uses transactions where possible
- Refreshes cache after operations
- Validates teacher existence before operations
- Handles both `teacherId` (single) and `teacherIds` (array) fields

### Performance
- Leverages cached teacher data for fast duplicate detection
- Bulk operations for course and session updates
- Minimal UI re-renders during operations

## Debug Tools

### Console Functions
Available in browser console:
```javascript
// Debug specific teacher by name
debugTeacher('Teacher Name')

// Show all duplicate teachers
logDuplicateTeachers()
```

### Visual Indicators

## Safety Features

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all database operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful fallback on operation failure

### Data Validation
- Checks for teacher existence before operations
- Validates course and session references
- Ensures cache consistency after changes

## Best Practices

### Before Merging
1. Review both teacher records carefully
2. Check course assignments and counts
3. Choose the teacher with the most complete/accurate data

### After Operations
1. Verify the operation completed successfully
2. Check that duplicate alerts are updated
3. Test related functionality (course views, etc.)

### Maintenance
- Regularly check for new duplicates after data imports
- Use debug tools to investigate data inconsistencies
- Monitor console for any operation errors

## Error Recovery

If an operation fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Refresh the page to reset state
3. Try the operation again
4. Contact support if errors persist
