## Technical Implementation

### Name Editing
- **Input Validation**: Prevents empty names and trims whitespace
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Visual Feedback**: Green border and "(BEARBEITUNG)" indicator during editing
- **Cache Refresh**: Automatic teacher cache invalidation after updates
- **Conflict Prevention**: Disables other actions during editing

### Database Operations
- **Merge**: Updates courses, sessions, and teacher records atomically
- **Delete**: Removes all references before deleting the teacher record
- **Update**: Uses dedicated `updateTeacher()` function with cache refresh
- **Validation**: Checks for active courses and warns users

### Data Integrity
- Uses transactions where possible
- Refreshes cache after operations
- Validates teacher existence before operations
- Handles both `teacherId` (single) and `teacherIds` (array) fields

### Performance
- Leverages cached teacher data for fast duplicate detection
- Bulk operations for course and session updates
- Minimal UI re-renders during operations
- Immediate visual feedback during editing

## Debug Tools

### Console Functions
Available in browser console:
```javascript
// Debug specific teacher by name
debugTeacher('Teacher Name')

// Show all duplicate teachers
logDuplicateTeachers()

// Update teacher programmatically
updateTeacher('teacher-id', { name: 'New Name', country: 'Germany' })
```

### Visual Indicators

### Error Handling

### Data Validation
- Checks for teacher existence before operations
- Validates course and session references
- Ensures cache consistency after changes

## Best Practices

### Name Editing
1. Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., "Firstname Lastname")
2. Avoid special characters that might cause issues
3. Check for duplicates after editing names
4. Use proper capitalization and spacing

### Before Merging
1. Review both teacher records carefully
2. Check course assignments and counts
3. Choose the teacher with the most complete/accurate data
4. Consider editing names first if they're just typos

### After Operations
1. Verify the operation completed successfully
2. Check that duplicate alerts are updated
3. Test related functionality (course views, etc.)
4. Look for any remaining inconsistencies

### Maintenance
- Regularly check for new duplicates after data imports
- Standardize teacher names during editing
- Use debug tools to investigate data inconsistencies
- Monitor console for any operation errors

## Common Workflows

### Fixing Duplicate Names
1. **Typo Fix**: If names are similar (e.g., "John Smith" vs "John Smth"), edit the incorrect one
2. **Same Person**: If both entries represent the same person, use merge functionality
3. **Different People**: If they're actually different people with the same name, add distinguishing information

### Bulk Name Cleanup
1. Filter to show only duplicates
2. Edit obvious typos first
3. Merge confirmed duplicates
4. Verify all changes took effect

## Error Recovery

If an operation fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Refresh the page to reset state
3. Try the operation again
4. Contact support if errors persist
